# TextToSpeach

Simple Python based Text To Speach program using gTTS.  
I made this for my final in AP Computer Science.

Expect some errors and somethings that could be optimized.

**Note**  
If you want it to talk in a different language you have to type the words in the other language. It doesn't translate.  
I might add that in the future but as of right now nah.

**Note 2**  
If you are on windows and are using Windows Media Player (only one I tested) you have to close it between words.
