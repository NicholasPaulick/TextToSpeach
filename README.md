# TextToSpeach

Simple Python based Text To Speach program using gTTS.

I made this for my final in AP Computer Science.

Expect some errors and somethings that could be optimized.

*Note
If you want it to talk in a different language you have to type the words in the other language. It doesn't translate.
I might add that in the future but as of right now nah.
